# Nawaetu Commercial License

Nawaetu is distributed under a **Dual Licensing** model. By default, the software is available under the **GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3)**. This ensures that the code remains open and free for the community.

However, the AGPLv3 imposes specific restrictions that may not be suitable for all organizations, particularly those building proprietary or closed-source applications.

## Why a Commercial License?

The AGPLv3 requires that any modifications made to this software, as well as any applications that link to or use this software over a network, must also be released as open-source under the AGPLv3.

A **Commercial License** grants you an exemption from these open-source requirements. It allows you to:

1. **Keep Your Source Code Private**: You can use, modify, and integrate Nawaetu's code into your proprietary projects without being forced to open-source your own code.
2. **White-label the Application**: You can rebrand Nawaetu with your own logo, name, and identity without attributing the original source in your public-facing application.
3. **Monetize Your Service**: You can sell your modified version of the software as a Service (SaaS) or distribute it commercially under your own terms.
4. **Receive Priority Support**: Gain direct access to the maintainer for technical assistance and customized solutions.

## Who Needs a Commercial License?

You **DO NOT** need a commercial license if:
* You are studying the code for personal use.
* You are building a 100% open-source project and are willing to release your code under the AGPLv3.
* You are using Nawaetu for a non-profit organization and agree to the AGPLv3 terms (including sharing any modifications publicly).

You **DO** need a commercial license if:
* You want to use Nawaetu in a closed-source product.
* You want to offer Nawaetu as a heavily modified, branded service to your customers (White-label) without releasing your source code.
* Your company policies prohibit the use of "strong copyleft" (AGPL) licenses.
