## 🚀 What's Next

### Q2 2026: The Intention Revolution

**Theme:** *Making Nawaetu the ONLY app that tracks your niat*

#### 🆕 Intention Journal (MVP)
**Status:** 🔨 In Development

The feature that makes Nawaetu truly unique.

**What it does:**
- Set your daily intention every morning (Fajr time)
- Evening reflection: "How did you honor your niat today?"
- Track your "Niat Streak" - consecutive days of intentional living
- Private by default, shareable if you choose

**Why it matters:**
> "I used to just check off prayers mechanically. Now I start each day asking *why* I'm doing this. It's changed everything." - Beta tester

**Impact:** This is our **category-defining feature**. No other Islamic app does this.

---

#### 🤖 AI Niat Coach v2.0
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Upgrade from reactive Q&A bot to proactive spiritual mentor.

**New capabilities:**
- **Daily check-ins:** "How's your Fajr habit going this week?"
- **Personalized insights:** "You pray better when you sleep before 11pm"
- **Behavioral coaching:** Combines Islamic wisdom + habit science
- **Accountability:** Gentle reminders aligned with your goals

**Example interaction:**
```
AI: Assalamu'alaikum! I noticed you've missed Fajr 3 times this week. 
    Want to talk about what's blocking you?

You: I just can't wake up...

AI: I understand. 87% of Muslims struggle with this. Let's try something:
    1. Set your niat tonight: "Ya Allah, help me wake for Fajr"
    2. Sleep 15 min earlier (just 15!)
    3. Put your phone across the room
    
    Can you commit to trying this for 3 days?
```

---

#### 🎮 Gamification Refresh
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Make points and levels actually *mean* something.

**Changes:**
- **XP → Niat Points (NP)** - Every action starts with intention
- **Islamic Milestones:**
  - Level 1-10: **Mubtadi** (Beginner)
  - Level 11-20: **Mutaqin** (The Pious)
  - Level 21-30: **Muhsinin** (The Excellent)
  - Level 31+: **Siddiqin** (The Truthful)
  
- **Meaningful Badges:**
  - 🌅 "Sahur Champion" - 30-day Ramadan streak
  - 🌙 "Night Warrior" - 100 Qiyamul Lail prayers
  - 💎 "Pure Intention" - 40-day niat streak

**Why:** Gamification should inspire spiritual growth, not just dopamine hits.

---

### Q3 2026: Community & Connection

**Theme:** *You don't have to build habits alone*

#### 👥 Accountability Partners
**Status:** 💡 Concept

Find your intention buddy.

**Features:**
- Match with Muslims working on similar goals
- Share reflections (optional, private by default)
- Gentle accountability: "Your partner prayed Fajr today. Your turn!"
- Group challenges: "30 Days of Dhuha with 100 others"

**Privacy-first:** All sharing is opt-in. Your niat stays private unless you choose.

---

#### 📖 Nawaetu Stories
**Status:** 💡 Concept

Real stories from real Muslims.

**Content:**
- "How I Finally Conquered Fajr" - User testimonials
- "From 0 to 100 Quran Pages" - Journey highlights
- "My Ramadan Transformation" - Seasonal inspiration

**Why:** Seeing others succeed makes you believe you can too.

### 🌐 Expansion & Accessibility

#### 🧩 Nawaetu Browser Extension (Chrome/Edge)
**Status:** 🏗️ POC (Proof of Concept)
