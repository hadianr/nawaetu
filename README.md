> *"Innama al-a'malu bin-niyyat" - Indeed, actions are judged by intentions.*

**Current Version: v1.4.0** | [Read in Indonesian 🇮🇩](README.id.md) | [See Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

**Nawaetu** (derived from "Niat" or Intention) is a gamified Islamic habit tracker designed to help you stay consistent (istiqamah) in your worship amidst the busy modern life. We believe every good deed starts with a **sincere intention**—and gamification can be a powerful motivator to build lasting spiritual habits.

## 🎯 Philosophy: Start with the Right Intention

**"Pure Intention, Build Habits, Consistent Action"**

Nawaetu combines habit-building psychology with Islamic principles. In an era full of distractions, maintaining consistency is hard. Nawaetu serves as your *habit-building companion* to make worship more engaging:

- 🎨 **Aesthetic & Minimal** - Modern UI that brings peace, not distraction.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered** - Ask anything, 24/7, with dalil-backed answers.
- 🎮 **Gamified System** - Daily Missions, Streak Counter, XP & Level Up.
- 🚀 **Lightning Fast** - Optimized performance, feels like a native app.
- 💯 **100% Ad-Free** - Focus on worship, not ads.

**Tagline**: *"Level up your faith, one habit at a time"* 🚀
