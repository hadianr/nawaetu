### 🎯 Track Your Niat, Build Your Legacy
**Nawaetu** (derived from "Niat" or Intention) is the **world's first Intention-First Islamic habit tracker**. While most apps focus on the ritual mechanics (calculating times, counter digits), Nawaetu focuses on the **spiritual heart** of worship: **The Intention.**

## 🎯 What Makes Nawaetu Different?

**Every Islamic app has prayer times, Quran, and Qibla. But almost none focus on the *why* behind your worship.**

### The Nawaetu Uniqueness:
1.  🎯 **The Intention-First Pioneer**: We treat "Niat" as a trackable habit, moving spiritual growth from the fingers (counters) to the heart.
2.  🤖 **Tanya Nawaetu**: Specialized Islamic Q&A backed by Quran, Sunnah, and authenticated Hadith.
3.  📔 **The Muhasabah Loop**: Seamlessly bridges the gap between morning intentions and evening reflections.
4.  🎮 **Spiritual Hasanah**: Replaces generic gamification with meaningful Islamic milestones and "Istiqamah Streaks."
5.  ️ **Enterprise Ready**: Built from day one with dual-licensing, whitelabel support, and a scalable Next.js architecture.
